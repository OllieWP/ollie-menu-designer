== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I create my first dropdown menu? =

After installing the plugin, add a Navigation block to your site (usually in your header template). Then add the Menu Designer block inside the navigation. Click "Create New" to design your menu template in the Site Editor.

= How do I create a custom mobile menu? =

In any Navigation block, go to the block settings and find the Mobile Menu panel. Select a mobile design template or create a new one. Your custom mobile menu will automatically replace the default mobile navigation on smaller screens.

= Can I use this with my existing theme? =

Yes! Menu Designer works with any theme that supports navigation blocks. This includes all block themes and many classic themes with navigation block support.

= How do I make different menus for different pages? =

Both dropdown menus and mobile menus are saved as template parts. You can create multiple template parts and use different ones on different navigation menus throughout your site.

= Can I disable dropdown menus on mobile? =

Absolutely! Each dropdown menu has a "Disable in mobile menu" option. You can also specify a fallback URL that mobile users will navigate to instead.

= Is this accessible? =

Yes! The plugin follows WordPress accessibility standards with proper ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation support, and screen reader compatibility.

= Will this slow down my site? =

No. Dropdown menus are loaded efficiently only when needed. The plugin uses modern performance techniques including lazy loading and optimized asset delivery.
