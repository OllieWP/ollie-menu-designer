= Adding Starter Patterns =

You can create custom starter patterns for menu templates to give users quick starting points for their menus. This is especially useful for theme developers who want to provide pre-designed menu layouts.

**How to Add Starter Patterns**

1. Create a `/patterns` folder in your theme or plugin directory
2. Add your pattern files (PHP format) to this folder
3. In each pattern file, ensure you include the following in your pattern header:

`Block Types: core/template-part/menu`

This ensures your pattern appears as an option when creating new menu template parts.

= Requirements =

* WordPress 6.5 or higher
* A WordPress block theme like [Ollie](https://olliewp.com) that supports the WordPress navigation block

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this work with my existing theme? =

Yes! Ollie Menu Designer works with any theme that supports WordPress navigation blocks. This includes all block themes and many classic themes with navigation block support. For the best experience with pre-designed menu patterns, we recommend using the free Ollie theme. You can search for "Ollie" on your Themes page in the WordPress dashboard, or visit olliewp.com to download and learn more about the theme.

= Where can I get more templates and patterns? =

Ollie Menu Designer comes with several starter patterns, but for access to hundreds of professionally-designed menu templates and patterns, check out Ollie Pro. [Ollie Pro](https://olliewp.com/pro) includes an extensive pattern library with multiple menu collections, dropdown designs, and mobile menu layouts that work seamlessly with Menu Designer.

= How is this different from other menu plugins? =

Unlike traditional menu plugins built for classic themes, Ollie Menu Designer is built specifically for the WordPress block editor. You design menus using the same blocks you use for pages - no separate interface or complex settings screens.

= Can I have different menus on different pages? =

Absolutely! Since menus are saved as template parts, you can create multiple dropdown and mobile menu designs and use different ones throughout your site by adding them to different navigation blocks.

= What happens to my menus if I deactivate the plugin? =

Your menu template parts remain in your site as regular template parts. However, the dropdown and mobile menu functionality will stop working until you reactivate the plugin.

= Can I import/export my menu designs? =

Yes! Since menus are built with WordPress blocks, you can copy and paste menu designs between sites, or export them as part of your theme's pattern library.

= Will this conflict with other menu plugins? =

Ollie Menu Designer is designed to work alongside WordPress's native navigation system. However, we recommend deactivating other menu plugins to avoid potential conflicts and ensure the best performance.

= Is this plugin accessible? =

Yes! Ollie Menu Designer follows WordPress accessibility standards with proper ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation support, and screen reader compatibility.

= Will this slow down my website? =

No. Ollie Menu Designer uses modern performance techniques including efficient loading, optimized CSS delivery, and follows WordPress best practices.

= Can I style menus with custom CSS? =

While Ollie Menu Designer gives you extensive design control through blocks and Global Styles, you can also add custom CSS if needed. All menu elements use semantic HTML with proper CSS classes for easy targeting.
